## 10/21/2025 - Planning Done And Schematic Finished  

Today 21st October : Started ![MP3 SCHEMATIC.PNG](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mzk2NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--bc21fab4448dd882564240c704dd967f7b8d329e/MP3%20SCHEMATIC.PNG)


Today , i planned all in my mind and sarted working upon the schematic . I used EasyEda for this project as it would be easier for my to directly have access to lcsc parts and also get ot assembled by JLCPCB . This was the frst step of mine towards this , i did the schematics very carefully without any errors [ Most Probably ] and also the DRC says all correct . I started by frst importing all the parts/components required first and then i did the wiring . Now After 3 Hours of planning and working on schematic , I've finished and writing this journal entry . After This , I'll proceed with drawing the rough sketch of the pcb layout and routing the pcb .
